# Movie Recommendation Web App

**Problem**

With thousands of movies released every year, users often struggle to find movies that match their preferences. The overwhelming number of options necessitates a personalized solution to recommend content effectively.

**Solution**

I built a **content-based Movie Recommendation Web App** that suggests movies similar to a user-selected title. The app integrates Python, Streamlit, and TMDB APIs to deliver recommendations in an interactive, visually appealing format, complete with movie posters.

**Impact**
- Simplifies movie discovery for users by presenting curated options.
- Enhances the viewing experience by tailoring recommendations to user preferences.
- Demonstrates the potential of AI to solve real-world problems through practical applications.

**Summary**

This project utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset and calculates consine similarity to recommend movies based on content features. The web app allows users to select a movie, view five recommendations, and explore them visually with poster images. Designed with **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface, the system showcases the power of **consine similarity** and **content-based filtering** in addressing everyday challenges.
